# SPARKY
The Little Stick Welder with Big Features.

Welcome to the Sparky Stick Welder project.  It's a low cost Chinese built stick welder that's been DiY upgraded to enhance its features.
The upgrade is driven by an ESP32 with 16MB FLASH. Several new features are added, including a color touch screen, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) control, DAC voice playback, and high current measuring capabilities.

### Features:
-  Uses low cost ($60 USD) ZX7-200 type Inverter Welding Machine.
-  Color TFT Screen displays welding current, arc voltage, and menus.
-  Touch Screen for selecting features. Built-in help screens display useful welding tips too.
-  Programmable Pulse current mode for enhanced stick welding.
-  Helmet mounted Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Button for remote Amps control.
-  Audio for announcing Amps and over-temp alerts.
-  Flash memory for saving power-up defaults.
-  Low cost components (~$40 USD).
-  Non invasive design, no permanent changes to the welder.

### Skills Required:
This project is suitable for most advanced electronic circuit builders that are familiar with high voltage safety.
Step-by-step wiring instructions and "Heathkit" type pictorial wiring diagrams are not provided. But 
basic build information is available in the project blog at:

### Warning:
An inverter welder is a potentially dangerous machine. Lethal primary voltages (>300 volts) are present inside the cabinet,
even after power is turned off. The involved currents have more than enough energy to vaporize misplaced wiring (and misguided hand 
tools) in a dangerously hot explosive flash. Proceed at your own risk.
